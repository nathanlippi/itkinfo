        	<p>Since 2001 ITK has been helping companies use   information to their advantage.   We collaborate with you to help you   work smarter on several levels.  First -  companies that we   work with constantly have vital business information at their   fingertips.   Information about their own company's representation in   traditional and social media, their key competitors, and relevant   industry news.   Just as importantly companies aren't wasting their   valuable internal resources looking for this information, but rather marshalling   their people to use the information to take actions that really affect   profitability and the bottom line. </p>
            <p> <br/>
            ITK uses specially trained researchers with specific   industry experience to gather and filter through thousands of news sources   in order to deliver results that are both concise and thorough. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In   addition to our daily or weekly news briefs we offer other important   services to support Corporate Communications executives and PR   professionals.   These include compiling research briefs on   companies, journalists or any other topic that you need coverage on.     We also provide coverage tracking for press releases.  </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We   love what we do here and think that the best way to grow our company is through   the word of mouth of satisfied clients.  In order to achieve this we strive   to over-deliver on expectations every single day.  Get in touch today to   get started on a free trial of our services so you can see first   hand how we can do the same for you. </p>
